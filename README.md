# AI-Powered-Cross-Crop-Companion-Planting-advisor

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered tool** that helps farmers and gardeners choose the best crop combinations for companion planting. It uses machine learning to recommend which crops grow well together, how to allocate land, and how to optimize water, soil, and fertilizer usage for sustainable agriculture.

## Features

- **Smart Companion Recommendations:** Suggests the best companion crops for any main crop you enter.
- **Avoid List:** Tells you which crops should not be planted together.
- **Irrigation & Water Needs:** Calculates daily water requirements and recommends the best irrigation method.
- **Land Allocation:** Suggests how to divide your land among recommended crops.
- **Soil & Fertilizer Advice:** Recommends the best soil type and fertilizer amount based on your crops and area.
- **Seasonal Guidance:** Suggests the best season for your crop combination.
- **Visual Analysis:** Includes graphs for model evaluation, feature importance, crop networks, and more.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** Enter your main crop and field conditions (soil moisture, pH, temperature).
2. **AI Processing:** The system uses trained machine learning models and real agricultural data to generate recommendations.
3. **Output:** Get a full report on companion crops, irrigation, land allocation, soil, fertilizer, and more.
